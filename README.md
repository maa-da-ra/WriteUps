 Writeups of machines and boxes


DISCLAIMER: I am a noob aspiring to nail a career change towards pentesting and hopefully red-teaming at some point. While at it I 'll be keeping notes for the sake of being OSCP EXAM ready when the time comes,

----> BUT <----

I 'll be leaving within these notes all the batshit crazy approaches only a noob could think of as I go. This is so that later on, if a noob stumbles upon these notes, they 'll understand for themselves the inevitability of mistake, error, wrong path, en route to becoming educated and job ready proffessionals.
